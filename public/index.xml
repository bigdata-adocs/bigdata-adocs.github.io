      <description>Digital twins for accelerated discovery of climate and sustainability solutionsDigital twins are digital representation of a physical products or processes where a real object exchange data with a virtual counterpart. Digital twins become possible due to the availability of real time stream of Internet of Things sensor data, large scale physical and engineering simulations and massive volume of data that enable AI model training. The volume and quality of data makes digital twins a &amp;ldquo;virtual digital sandbox&amp;rdquo; for testing scenarios, efficient AI model testing and accelerated insight in complex system behaviors.</description>
